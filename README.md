Got a bunch of stuff laying around that you no longer use? Don't throw it away! Put it up on Bodega Swap!

How does it work?

Bodega Swap is a platform that allows users to trade their "trash" for someone else's "treasures".  After making an account, you can create a listing to offer up an item that you want to get rid of. You can browse items that other users have listed, and if you are interested, you can propose a swap!

Items are listed based on category, and you will be able to search for items based either on this category, or based on a search query. Alternatively, you can view all available items.

After a swap has been proposed, the receiver of the proposal has the option to accept the deal, reject the deal, or to initiate a haggle. If a haggle is initiated, you and your swapmate will be taken to a screen that allows you both to haggle over the swap. You will both be able to see all of each other's listed items, and can propose alternate items than were included in the original swap. This screen will also allow you to communicate with your swapmate in real time.

Once a swap has been agreed upon, users will be responsible for arranging a meetup to complete the swap, or to arrange another method of exchange. After a swap has been completed, both parties will be able to rate each other according to how the transaction went. This rating system allows Bodega Swap to discourage dishonest parties from taking advantage of honest users.
